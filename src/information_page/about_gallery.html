<h2><font color="blue">How to Use Gallery page?</font></h2>

  <p>
    At the top of the gallery page, you'll find a series of <font color="blue">thumbnail images</font> from the test dataset.
    To select an image for analysis, simply click on the corresponding thumbnail.
  </p>

  <p>
    After selecting an image, the application will process it using the pre-trained neural networks.
    This may take a few seconds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once processing is complete, the page will display the <font color="purple">original image</font>,
    the <font color="orange">annotated mask provided by the dataset authors</font>, and the <font color="green">mask generated by the neural network</font>.
    These will appear in order beneath the selection bar. Images are <font color="teal">enlargeable  by 10%</font> on hover.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below the neural network's mask, you'll find an expander titled "<font color="maroon">Performance Metrics</font>".
    Click on this to view the performance metrics for the selected image in a tabular format.
  </p>

  <p>
    To select a different image for analysis, click on another thumbnail from the top row.
    The <font color="blue">top row of thumbnails</font> is always visible and clickable, allowing for easy navigation and comparison.
