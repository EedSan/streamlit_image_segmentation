<h2><font color="blue">How to use Performance Metrics page?</font></h2>

<p>This page presents a visual comparison of the performance of three different neural networks: <font color="#20b2aa">U-Net</font>, <font color="#20b2aa">SegNet</font>, and <font color="#20b2aa">DeconvNet</font>, across four key metrics: <font color="#20b2aa">Loss</font>, <font color="#20b2aa">Pixel Accuracy</font>, <font color="#20b2aa">IoU (Intersection over Union)</font>, and <font color="#20b2aa">Dice Coefficient</font>.</p>

<p>The performance metrics plots are <font color="purple">presented in a series of expandable sections</font>, one for each metric. </p>

<p>Within each section, you will find a <font color="purple">row of three graphs</font>, each one corresponding to a different neural network. Each graph shows how the performance of the network on the given metric changed over the training. </p>

<p>These graphs present performance on the <font color="green">training</font> (shown in <font color="green">green</font>) and the <font color="orange">validation</font> (shown in <font color="orange">orange</font>) set.</p>


<p>Below each row of graphs, you will find a text description providing further details about the respective metric and the corresponding plots.</p>

<p>Feel free to expand and collapse the sections to view the metrics you're most interested in, and use these graphs to get a sense of how each neural network performed over the course of training.</p>
