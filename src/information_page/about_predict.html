<ol>
  <li><font>Click on the "Browse files" button and select the required image from your computer.
    <font color="red"> Important Note: At the moment system can only process 16-bit TIF geo-images with a resolution of 256x256 pixels.</font></font></li>
  <li><font>After uploading the image, select the neural network architecture you want to use for prediction. You can switch between U-Net, SegNet, and DeconvNet by selecting corresponding model from dropdown menu.</font></li>
  <li><font>Wait a few seconds for the system to process the image and generate the prediction.</font></li>
</ol>

<h2><font color="blue">Results</font></h2>

<p><font >The results consist of two parts: the image you uploaded, and an image mask highlighting the area where fire is detected, if any.</font></p>
